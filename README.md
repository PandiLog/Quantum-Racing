# Quantum Racing | Electraton Suspension System
Steering Knuckle Digitization
Project Overview
This repository contains the CAD development of a suspension steering knuckle for the Quantum Racing team, part of the Electraton electric vehicle competition.

The primary goal was to bridge the gap between existing physical components and digital engineering.

Technical Highlights

High-Fidelity Modeling: Digitized the physical steering knuckle into a high-precision 3D model using SolidWorks.

# Key Results
Developed a complete digital twin of the steering assembly for future iterations.

Applied GD&T (ASME Y14.5-2018) principles to ensure proper alignment and assembly fit.

# Technologies Used

CAD: SolidWorks .
