# Quantum-RacingQuantum Racing | Electraton Suspension System
Steering Knuckle Digitization & FEA Validation
Project Overview
This repository contains the CAD development and structural validation of a suspension steering knuckle for the Quantum Racing team, part of the Electraton electric vehicle competition.

The primary goal was to bridge the gap between existing physical components and digital engineering, ensuring that the steering geometry could withstand race-day loads through advanced simulation.

Technical Highlights

High-Fidelity Modeling: Digitized the physical steering knuckle into a high-precision 3D model using SolidWorks.



Structural Analysis (FEA): Performed linear static analysis to identify stress concentrations and verify the Factor of Safety (FoS).



Simulation-Driven Design: Leveraged CSWA-Simulation methodologies to validate structural integrity under critical loading conditions (braking and cornering).


Key Results
Developed a complete digital twin of the steering assembly for future iterations.

Conducted stress analysis that allowed the team to understand the component's limits without the cost of physical destructive testing.

Applied GD&T (ASME Y14.5-2018) principles to ensure proper alignment and assembly fit.
